# Gazetteer

Gazetteer is a “mobile first” website providing profiling for all countries as well as major cities across the globe, with data collected through third party APIs.

If permission is granted, the map will zoom to the current country. Clicking the home marker will also display information about the current location - the weather, a local Wikipedia entry as well as Covid data for that country.

The user then has the option to select any other country from the drop-down menu. The map will zoom to the country selected, where the top ten cities (depending on population) will appear on the map as markers.

Buttons will also appear on the left hand side of the map. Clicking each of these will display Covid statistics, a currency converter, an image gallery and news stories about the selected country. If certain information for a particular country is not available, the relevant button will not appear and the user will be notified.

When the user clicks on one of the markers, a local weather report for that location will appear. Additional buttons will also be displayed containing more granular data - Wikipedia entries and weather details for that particular city.
